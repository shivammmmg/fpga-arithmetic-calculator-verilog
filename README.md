# FPGA Arithmetic Calculator (Verilog)

A 4-bit arithmetic calculator implemented in **Verilog** on the **Intel DE10-Lite FPGA**.  
This project performs both **addition** and **two’s-complement subtraction**, displaying inputs and results in real time on the board’s **seven-segment displays**.  
It demonstrates fundamental digital logic design concepts, including **ripple-carry addition**, **2’s complement arithmetic**, and **active-low display decoding**.
